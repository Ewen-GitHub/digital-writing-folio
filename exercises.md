### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do? (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)

I do nonfiction and poetry primarily - which stems (and coincides) with my passion for songwriting.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use Qwerty on my laptop. 
I mostly write in google drive as it is free.
I also write a lot with pen and paper intially - as ideas come out a lot better that way for me personally.
Most of my writing comes out of songwriting.
I usually need my own space to make ideas flow, although I sometimes get inspiration from everyday events and bludgeons. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Qwerty is basic writing tools that I have used my whole life so it is the easiest way for me to produce writing in a digital sense.

Because of the brand of my laptop, and the software/apps that are installed on there already - Google Drive seems the easiest way to write for me. I have tried to use word, however I'm always "urged" to buy the full version, which for some reason I cannot warrant the money. I may change that decision though as most work is submitted through a word document or something simlilar - which would make the process a lot simpler.

Using pen and paper really makes my mind concentrate a lot more - as I am forced into physically thinking about what I'm writing. It is an efficient way for me to write, however I am not the general public and this may be just a unique technique that works for me. I often pick up a guitar and words seem to come out in relation to the music -often I don't know what the song is about until I've finished the lyrics and read over them a lot - which I think is kinda cool.

I like to sit in a study, at a desk where distractions are limited and I am forced to work on the things that are directly in front of me - though sometimes when I have a brain block it does tend to help sitting a park and people watching for a while, just stemming ideas from the background. I can also get ideas just from watching tv or playing guitar; simple things like these have more substance than you would believe.

## Week 2
