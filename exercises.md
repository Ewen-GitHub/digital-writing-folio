### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do? (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)

I do nonfiction and poetry primarily - which stems (and coincides) with my passion for songwriting.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use Qwerty on my laptop. 
I mostly write in google drive as it is free.
I also write a lot with pen and paper intially - as ideas come out a lot better that way for me personally.
Most of my writing comes out of songwriting.
I usually need my own space to make ideas flow, although I sometimes get inspiration from everyday events and bludgeons. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Qwerty is basic writing tools that I have used my whole life so it is the easiest way for me to produce writing in a digital sense.

Because of the brand of my laptop, and the software/apps that are installed on there already - Google Drive seems the easiest way to write for me. I have tried to use word, however I'm always "urged" to buy the full version, which for some reason I cannot warrant the money. I may change that decision though as most work is submitted through a word document or something simlilar - which would make the process a lot simpler.

Using pen and paper really makes my mind concentrate a lot more - as I am forced into physically thinking about what I'm writing. It is an efficient way for me to write, however I am not the general public and this may be just a unique technique that works for me. I often pick up a guitar and words seem to come out in relation to the music -often I don't know what the song is about until I've finished the lyrics and read over them a lot - which I think is kinda cool.

I like to sit in a study, at a desk where distractions are limited and I am forced to work on the things that are directly in front of me - though sometimes when I have a brain block it does tend to help sitting a park and people watching for a while, just stemming ideas from the background. I can also get ideas just from watching tv or playing guitar; simple things like these have more substance than you would believe.

## Week 2

- [x] Read and select 3 works from the E.L.C that you find interesting
- [x] How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- [x] What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?
- [x] What aspects of the remix are the same?
- [x] What aspects of the remix are different?
- [x] Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

### Electronic Literature Collection

I found works like bpNichol's [First Screening](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-screening), Jim Munroe's [Everybody Dies](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/munroe_everybodydies.html) and [Up Against the Screen Motherfuckers](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/katko_up_against_the_screen.html) by Justin Katko the most interesting and will focus on
one of these works for my first assignment.

#### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

Electronic literature is much more accessible than print literature - if you want to read something you can usually just look it up rather than going
through the whole process of finding a print copy. Electronic Literature (E.L) also has endless forms. While print is very limited in the way in can be presented (maybe you can turn the page landscape to mix it up) E.L can be interactive, visual, moving, film, text, colour, easy, difficult.

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?
 
 Because E.L is so limitless it is actually quite hard to define the individual qualities that it entails. In my opinion E.L has to be in some way digital, and has to involve some form of literature (which as we discovered last week - is also pretty impossible to define). I believe it has to have some kind of creative drive behind it - or needs to be a "creation" of the author, come to life.

### [Along the Briny Beach](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/along_the_briny_beach/) - Taroko Gorge Remix

#### What aspects of the remix are the same?

Both of these poems have a basis around the constant, and structured flow of the lines. This is to purpose the shared theme of nature and place - particularly of the flowing water (in Taroko Gorge it specifically talks about "flow", in Along the Briny beach it is about the beach; the waves, the salt water).

#### What aspects of the remix are different?

Along the Briny Beach is essentially a more complicated version of Taroko Gorge - enveloping elements both vertically AND horizontally across the screen, also using imagery to represent the "flow" of the water - whereas in Taroko Gorge it is simply the words streaming down the page that you are drawn to.

#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

I think it is successful as the colours on the page are much more calming and inviting, and while there are more words coming from more places, it isn't overwhelming or hard to read. You can read each element at your on pace; I don't feel forced or rushed to read each section as quick as possible.

## Week 4

- [x] Create a Remix on Glitch

### Writing Hypertext Fiction
 
- [x] How is it different from fiction?
- [x] How is it different from games?
- [x] How do you plan fiction?
- [x] How could you plan hypertext fiction?
 
 #### How is it different from fiction?
 
 Hypertext fiction is much more interactive than fiction as it is online and able to be read and written in multiple ways.
 
 #### How is it different from games?
 
 While some of the coding can be very similar to that of games, hyperfiction is generally content on being more of a story than a game. However, some of the time it can be as simple as the author of the piece claiming it to be hypertext - rather than a game (even if you're playing through it).
 
 #### How do you plan fiction?
 
 I plan fiction writing by sprawling out a random array of ideas in a stream-of-conciousness type way - and try to expand on the ideas that I believe have potential and merit. Not too much planning generally happens in my fiction writing until well into the piece.
 
 #### How could you plan hypertext fiction?
 
 Hypertext Fiction is unfortunately very different. Because a lot of what I write - after its released - is out of my hands, I have to plan it so whatever path the reader takes I have to be content with how it is read, and where they end up.
