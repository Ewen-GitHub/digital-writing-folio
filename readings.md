### Electronic Literature: what is it?

Katherine Hayles’ text "Electronic Literature: what is it?" is a piece of writing that approaches the work of writers who are diving headfirst into new creative methods. Hayles identifies her aim to create a collection of electronic literature and to introduce it to readers and the university classroom alike. Hayles’ book provides an overview of the specifications on the subject, arguing that this new kind of writing requires a different critical perspective than its print predecessors, calling for an examination not just of what appears on screen - but the coding beneath.

### Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade

In this article by Jeremy Douglass, he discusses Andrew Plotkin's Shade within the history of interactive fiction. Douglass gives a brief rundown on IF and then proceeds to evaluate the tools that Plotkin used in order to develop his work. Douglass entails the process of the game feeling like a second person narrative - and how you are never truly in control of your actions, arguing that "without vision there is no agency".

## Week 3

### Indistinguishable from Magic

In the text this week provided by Lori Emerson, the topic of conversation is interfaces. Emerson states how rather than an interface being something that “simply (that which) opens up from one distinct space to another distinct space”, the interface is the site which determines the very nature of our approach to reading, writing, and navigating the world around us - often with an invisible, and at times even villainous, hand.
